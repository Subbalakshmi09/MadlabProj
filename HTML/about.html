        <h2>MadLab is a grassroots innovation organisation</h2>
        <p>We work with technology and people to shape our world for the better – combining a deep material understanding of new and emerging technologies with the tools and methods of participatory design. We navigate the complexities of innovation – delivering results, breaking ground, defying convention.<br> <br>

            Our work has been featured in The Guardian, Nature Methods, Sky, BBC, Creative Review, and Leonardo. We are regularly called on to speak at conferences and panel sessions internationally. <br><br>
